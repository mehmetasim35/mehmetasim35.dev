If you have an ongoing case with Migrationsverket (the Swedish Migration Agency) that has been pending for more than six months, you can request that the case be decided within four weeks according to <a href="https://lagen.nu/2017:900#P12S1" target="_blank">the Swedish Administrative Procedure Act, Section 12</a>.

Please note that if you have applied using paper documents, the calculation of time should start from the day when the case is `registered` with Migrationsverket (I received this information when I emailed Migrationsverket; it is not mentioned on their website). Be cautious in counting the six months, as incorrect calculation may result in a rejection.

_In this example, we count from January 2, 2023._

## How to Request a Decision on Your Case
You can fill out the form <a href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.1ef19f6e163f45d340aa52/1682667659674/271011_Request_conclude_case_en.pdf" target="_blank">Request to conclude a case (form number 271011)</a> and email it to `migrationsverket@migrationsverket.se` or send it by mail to Migrationsverket, 601 70 Norrköping, Sweden. I recommend sending it via email as it is faster.

## What to Do If Your Request is Rejected
It is quite common for people's requests to have their cases decided to be rejected by Migrationsverket. Currently, the decisions are automated at the agency, and the rejection reasoning may be as follows:

Migrationsverket has not been able to make a decision on your citizenship case within four weeks, and therefore, they reject your request.

## How to Appeal the Decision

The appeal must be in writing.
Here are some `examples` that show how to appeal. These examples are for Swedish citizenship, but you can customize them for your own case. I recommend that everyone writes their own appeal.

I also have this part in<a href="posts/begaran-om-att-avgora-arende/#hur-man-överklagar-på-begäran" target="_blank">swedish</a>.
You need to include some personal information in the appeal:
```
Name:
Personal ID No.:
Case reference number:
Address:
Email address:
Phone number:

**Appeal here**

Place and date
Signature
```

Example 1:
```
Hello!
I would like to appeal the decision regarding my case where Migrationsverket decided to reject my request for a decision on my application for Swedish citizenship. According to the Swedish Administrative Procedure Act (2017:900), Section 12, Migrationsverket should decide on the citizenship case within four weeks. I have not received any decision regarding my application for Swedish citizenship, and therefore, I would like to appeal the decision. I hope that you will make a positive decision as soon as possible.
```

Example 2:
```
I would like to appeal Migrationsverket's decision to reject my request to have my case regarding Swedish citizenship decided. It has been more than six months since I applied for citizenship. According to the law, I have the right to receive a decision from Migrationsverket within four weeks from the day they received my request. I fulfill all the requirements to obtain Swedish citizenship, and there are no compelling reasons justifying an extension of the decision period.
```

Example 3:
```
I would like to appeal Migrationsverket's decision to reject my request to have my case regarding Swedish citizenship decided within four weeks. I submitted my application for Swedish citizenship more than six months ago. According to the law, I believe that I have the right to receive a decision from Migrationsverket within four weeks from the day they received my request. I fulfill all the requirements to obtain Swedish citizenship, and there are no compelling reasons for further delaying the decision.
```

Example 4:
```
I want to appeal Migrationsverket's decision regarding my request to have my case decided. My case concerns obtaining Swedish citizenship, and I wish for it to be decided as soon as possible.
```

Example 5:
```
I want to appeal Migrationsverket's decision regarding my request to have my case decided. My case concerns obtaining Swedish citizenship, and I wish for it to be decided as soon as possible.

## Important Points to Remember
- You can only request the case to be decided once.
- The appeal must be made within three weeks from the date you received the decision.
- An appeal does not guarantee a change in the decision, but it provides an opportunity to try to change it.

It is important to remember that this guide is only a summary and does not replace legal advice. For more detailed information and specific instructions, it is recommended to contact Migrationsverket or a legal expert.

I hope this guide helps you understand the process of requesting a decision on your case and the appeal process. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!
