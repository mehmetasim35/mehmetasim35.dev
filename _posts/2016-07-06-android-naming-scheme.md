I really like Android's confectionary-themed naming scheme. It's really sweet (pun intended ðŸ˜‰). And it also goes in alphabetical order. I guess the question is what happens when they reach Z.

- First version not named. (A)
- Second version also not named. (B)
- **C**upcake
- **D**onut
- **E**clair
- **F**royo
- **G**ingerbread
- **H**oneycomb
- **I**ce Cream Sandwich
- **J**elly Bean
- **K**itKat
- **L**ollipop
- **M**arshmallow
- **N**ougat
- **O**reo
- **P**ie

###### Update 2019:
Ok so they did that for 10 years between 2009 and 2019 and have now ended this naming scheme. Future Android versions will use numerical order like Android 10, Android 11 and so on.
