## What is Long-Term Residence (Varaktigt bosatt) and Why Should You Apply for It?

Long-Term Residence, also known as "Varaktigt bosatt" in Swedish, is a residence permit that allows you to live in many European countries, including Sweden. Getting this permit has great benefits. It means you can freely move and stay in different European countries without any restrictions.

You can find a list of these countries on the official website of Migrationsverket: 
- [Migrationsverket - Long-term Residents (English)](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/EU-EEA-citizens-and-long-term-residents/Long-term-residents.html)
- [Migrationsverket - Varaktigt bosatt (Swedish)](https://www.migrationsverket.se/Privatpersoner/EU-EES-medborgare-och-varaktigt-bosatta/Varaktigt-bosatt.html)

Another advantage is that once you have a long-term residence permit, you automatically get a permanent residence permit in Sweden. This is really good because it gives you the opportunity to apply for citizenship later on if you wish. 

## Who can apply?
To be granted long-term resident status, you must:

- have lived continuously in Sweden for five years
- have had a residence permit, or legal residence in Sweden on other grounds, for the previous five years.
- be able to support yourself and your family.

If you have been granted a Swedish residence permit as a [person with subsidiary protection status](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Protection-and-asylum-in-Sweden/When-you-have-received-a-decision-on-your-asylum-application/If-you-are-allowed-to-stay/Residence-permits-for-those-granted-subsidiary-protection-status-.html), you cannot be granted long-term resident status.

## How to apply?

Every person who applies for long-term residence permit in Sweden is `examined individually`. Everyone, including spouse/partner or children, `must submit their own application`.

The documents you see below are in Swedish because the application form is only available in Swedish.

To complete your application, you need to collect the `mandatory documents`. You may also include `optional documents` I provided if you wish.

Here is a table of contents that you can include in your documents to make things easier for people working on Migrationsverket:

Here is an example of how to fill out the long-term residence form. Keep in mind that that the information I provided can vary from person to person.
<iframe allow="autoplay" height="350" src="//drive.google.com/file/d/1stmplpudkKL1uRdrHX17mylznFrWup7o/preview" width="640"></iframe>

<br>

<span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(5, 146, 245);">2. Receipt of payment. (optional)<!--  -->

To submit your application, you need to pay an application fee. After making the payment, you can include a bank statement as proof.  You can find how to make a payment [here](https://indomet.github.io/posts/long-term-residence-permit-sweden/#how-to-make-a-payment).

Here is an example of a payment receipt:
<iframe allow="autoplay" height="350" src="//drive.google.com/file/d/1v4b7OCEVuk4Dlu26oA7QqkH0R8MoOVTk/preview" width="640"></iframe>

<br>

<span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(5, 146, 245);">3. Fotocopy of passport.<!--  -->

You need to scan or take a picture of your passport, starting from the first page up to and including the last used page. In many cases, a travel document or an alien's passport can be used if you do not have your home passport.

<br>

<span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(5, 146, 245);">4. Employment contract. <!--  -->

Here is an example of employement contract:
<iframe allow="autoplay" height="350" src="//drive.google.com/file/d/1FYv9ljtfEjy7O2jZw95zOYLqMd0EIhnh/preview" width="640"></iframe> 

<br>

<span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(5, 146, 245);">5. Latest salary specification. (It is good to include the most recent three) <!--  -->

Here is an example of salary specification:
<iframe allow="autoplay" height="350" src="//drive.google.com/file/d/1Vwo7NrLyqAf-C1LykwaYsY8CwqyE1rdA/preview" width="640"></iframe>

<br>

<span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(5, 146, 245);">6. Bank account statement. <!--  -->

You can request a bank account statement from your bank, or if you are using online banking, you can download it from your bank's website.

<br>

<span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(5, 146, 245);">7. Income information from the Swedish Tax Agency. <!--  -->

You can visit this page to access the income information in PDF form [Skatteverket - Current Information on Your Income](https://www.skatteverket.se/privat/skatter/arbeteochinkomst/seaktuellauppgifteromdininkomst.4.35c34f651660af3747c4df0.html#:~:text=Logga%20in%20f%C3%B6r%20att%20se,eller%20spara%20de%20sammanst%C3%A4llda%20uppgifterna). From there, you can log in to download the income information for either one or two years."

Here is an example about how it looks:
<iframe allow="autoplay" height="350" src="//drive.google.com/file/d/14XunV_8mIqB_2eS_1crsvA_8Eo7BAnqT/preview" width="640"></iframe>

<br>

<span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(5, 146, 245);">8. Housing (rental agreement, details of monthly costs). <!--  --> 

I would recommend that you consider creating an `inneboende` contract with your family members. This is because the amount of money required per person for long-term residence depends on whether you divide the costs or not. If the costs per person are lower, it could improve your chances of getting the permit. Since each person's application is reviewed individually, having a contract may actually help all of your family members to get the long-term residence permit. Here is a link to [inneboende contract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cK1ONuINS7RjeqoT4jxXeY-VMZ_kZ9vhKjPkjbMC9bw/edit?usp=drive_link) I have created. 
<iframe allow="autoplay" height="350" src="//drive.google.com/file/d/15Foa0avJvEI9HswXvW2CwWsQSxqw46-n/preview" width="640"></iframe>

Here is an example of the rental agreement:
<iframe allow="autoplay" height="350" src="//drive.google.com/file/d/1ebp6yJCl-ZuLDhEpMGUUUYpfWX2dof4X/preview" width="640"></iframe> 

Here is an example of the latest invoice:
<iframe allow="autoplay" height="350" src="//drive.google.com/file/d/1NyGyUG4V0-cjVujKzbi2Jn5-O7AttPYO/preview" width="640"></iframe>

<br>

<span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(5, 146, 245);">9. The family's total income. (optional) <!--  --> 

Although this part is not needed I would recommend you to include this, since you are trying to prove that you are able to support yourself and your family without being burden to the Swedish government. 

You can write the amount of money in your bank account and the value of other things, such as your car, within this document:
<iframe allow="autoplay" height="350" src="//docs.google.com/document/d/1Bn1NQgADnIwM9dPie2o95stzyZlSfMLpTgpeCfrm36I/preview" width="640"></iframe>


If you are applying as a family, it's a good idea to include employment contract, salary details and bank account statement for each family member in everybody's documents. If any family member already has permanent or long-term residence, it's better to include their salary information and bank account statement since they are part of the family.


## How to make a payment?
In the payment message box ("Meddelande till betalningsmottagaren"), provide the name, Swedish personal ID number, and/or case number of the person(s) for whom the application fee is being paid. If the fee is for multiple persons, include all their Swedish personal ID numbers and/or case numbers. `I would advise you to double check the information in the links below before paying it to make sure that the information on this page is up to date.`

- Bankgiro: 5223-7005

You can also pay using IBAN:

- IBAN Number: SE6912000000012810106908
- BIC/SWIFT Code: DABASESX (Danske Bank)
