### Logseq Page Export OPML to HTML

This tool converts OPML export of a [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) page that contains an embedded YouTube video and its corresponding notes to a standalone HTML webpage that can be sent to anyone. They will be able to just open it in a browser and follow the notes and video. The timestamps in the generated webpage are all clickable.
